## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project, I was able to learn and use CSS Grid properties. It's awesome because such properties allowed me to design specific layouts depending on the device one can see it.

### Continued development

It's very important to have tools like Css grid always fresh when doing projects because it's a widely used one and by practicing, I know I can use it with no significant difficulties.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Layout by MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This helped me to understand the basis of CSS Grid wih basic examples and easy-to-follow snipets.
